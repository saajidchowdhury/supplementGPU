Simulating 10004569 trajectories of atom (mass 86.9 amu, temp 1.0e-06 Kelvin) starting 5000.0 Bohr away from origin, 
colliding head-on at fixed speed with Paul-trapped ion (mass 170.9 amu) starting at rest at origin,
for simulated time 1000.0 microseconds using GPU with 8 cores.

We will use approximately 206.822 megabytes (MB) of storage (0.000 MB for workspace, 190.822 MB for csvs, 16.000 MB for figures).

The atom-ion potential is V(r) = -159.546/r^4 + 2.0e+09/r^8, with Re = 70.8 Bohr and De = 1.0e+00 Kelvin.
